# SQL_Project

---

## Dataset
- The dataset used for this project is uploaded in the `dataset/` folder.
- Format: CSV
- The raw dataset is used as input for both cleaning and analysis scripts.

> Note: The dataset is included for demonstration and learning purposes.

---

## SQL Scripts

### 1. Data Cleaning.sql
This script focuses on preparing the raw data for analysis by:
- Handling missing or null values
- Removing or identifying duplicates
- Standardising formats (dates, text, numeric fields)
- Performing basic data quality checks

Run this script first to ensure the dataset is analysis-ready.

---

### 2. Exploratory data analysis.sql
This script performs exploratory analysis such as:
- Summary statistics and aggregations
- Grouped analysis and segmentation
- Identifying trends and patterns
- Answering key business-style questions using SQL

Run this after the data cleaning steps are complete.
